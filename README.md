## node-build-monitor

> A __Build Monitor__ written in __Node.js__, which supports several build services. It can __be easily extended__ to support new services. You can __mix different services__ as you like and you'll always see the newest builds in its __responsive and themable web frontend__ automatically. And finally, everything is prepared to run as a __Docker__ container.

__Here's a demo:__ http://builds.mspi.es <sub><sup>([other themes](#theming-support))</sup></sub>
<br />
<sub>(automatically deployed from [this repository](docker/) with [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to the [Microsoft Azure Cloud](http://azure.microsoft.com/))</sub>

Feel free to make a [Fork](https://github.com/marcells/node-build-monitor/fork) of this repository and add another service.

Jump to the [configuration documentation](#configuration) and see how the services are configured.

### Quickstart

You have four options:

- Run node-build-monitor [by downloading the standalone version](#run-the-standalone-version-easiest-way) <sub><sup>(easiest way to run it)</sup></sub>
- Run node-build-monitor [manually with node](#run-it-manually-during-development) <sub><sup>(preferred during development)</sup></sub>
- Run node-build-monitor [with Docker Compose](#run-it-with-docker-compose-in-production) <sub><sup>(preferred in production)</sup></sub>
- Run node-build-monitor [in kubernetes](#run-it-in-kubernetes-as-a-helm-chart) <sub><sup>(as a helm chart)</sup></sub>

### Configuration

The build monitor configuration can be placed in one of the following locations:
1. `%HomeDirectory%/node-build-monitor-config.json`
2. `%PathOfExecutable%/config.json` (only for the standalone version)
3. `app/config.json`

```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "interval": 30000,
    "numberOfBuilds": 12,
    "latestBuildOnly": false,
    "sortOrder": "date",
    "errorsFirst": false,
    "expandEnvironmentVariables": false,
    "debug": true
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "Travis",
      "configuration": {
        "slug": "node-build-monitor"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Travis",
      "configuration": {
        "slug": "marcells/bloggy",
        "latestBuildOnly": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In the `monitor` section you can set up some general settings:

| Setting                      | Description
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `interval`                   | The update interval (in milliseconds)
| `numberOfBuilds`             | The number of builds, which will be read and displayed in the web frontend (ignored if `latestBuildOnly` is enabled)
| `latestBuildOnly`            | Will only retrieve single latest build from each service configuration. This setting can be overwritten in each service configuration.
| `sortOrder`                  | The sort order for buils, options : `project`, `date`
| `errorsFirst`                | Errors should be before success elements, apply sortOrder after that
| `expandEnvironmentVariables` | Tries to expand root service configuration properties from environment variables (e.g.: "${MY_PASSWORD}" will look for an environment variable `MY_PASSWORD` and will use that)
| `debug`                      | Enable or disable some debug output on the console

The `services` section accepts an array, each describing a single build service configuration (you are allowed to mix different services):
- the `name` setting refers to the used service
- the `configuration` setting refers to its configuration, which may differ from each service (see below)

### Run the standalone version (easiest way)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/marcells/node-build-monitor/releases/latest) for Linux (x64), MacOS (x64) or Windows (x64)
2. For MacOS and Linux you need to set the execute permission to run it
    - MacOS: `chmod +x node-build-monitor-macos`
    - Linux: `chmod +x node-build-monitor-linux`
3. Place a file `config.json` next to the executable (see the description of the file in the [configuration section](#configuration) above)
4. Run the executable
5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (switch to fullscreen for the best experience)

### Run it manually (during development)

1. Pull the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Place a file `config.json` in the app folder (see the description of the file in the [configuration section](#configuration) above)
4. *If you connect to services, which are using self signed certificates, then you have to set the environment variable`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`. ([More Info](https://github.com/marcells/node-build-monitor/issues/79))*
5. Run the build monitor with `node app/app.js`
6. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (switch to fullscreen for the best experience)

Run `grunt` to execute the tests and check the source code with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/).

### Run it with Docker Compose (in production)

You can try out or install the build monitor with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) easily.

__TL;DR:__ Go to the [docker directory](docker/), rename the file `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit with your configuration or create `config.json` file directly. Then run the following commands, which you need.

Below, each commands is explained in detail.

#### 1. Create configuration and set up the build monitor
Place a file `config.json` next to the `docker-compose.*.yml` and configure the services:
```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "interval": 30000,
    "numberOfBuilds": 12,
    "latestBuildOnly": false,
    "sortOrder": "date",
    "debug": true
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "Travis",
      "configuration": {
        "slug": "marcells/bloggy"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Travis",
      "configuration": {
        "slug": "marcells/node-build-monitor"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

See the description of this file in the configuration section above.

#### 2. Build your custom build monitor image and run the container

Build your custom node-build-monitor docker image. This will also include your configuration from the previous step. Afterwards the container is started.

##### a. Without tfs-proxy

Installing and running node-build-monitor in a docker container for use on the same machine is simple with the following commands:

Run docker-compose from your custom `docker-compose.yml`:
```
docker-compose build --pull
docker-compose up -d
```

##### b. With tfs-proxy

If you want to get access to the tfs-proxy, then you need a slighly different command, which allows the build monitor container to access the tfs-proxy container.

Run docker-compose from your custom `docker-compose.with-tfs-proxy.yml`:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-tfs-proxy.yml build --pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-tfs-proxy.yml up -d
```
Ensure that you omit the `tfsProxyUrl` setting in your `config.json`, so that it can be determined automatically. [Here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/#container-linking) you'll get more information about container linking.

##### c. With self-signed-certs

If you connect to services which are using self signed certificates, run docker-compose from your custom `docker-compose.with-self-signed-certs.yml`:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-self-signed-certs.yml build --pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-self-signed-certs.yml up -d
```

#### 3. Access it with your browser

Now open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your running or finished builds. Switch to fullscreen for the best experience.

#### (4. Access logs)

You can take a look at the logs of the build monitor by using this command:
```
docker-compose logs
```

### Run it in Kubernetes as a helm chart

You can use the helm chart to deploy node-build-monitor in your kubernetes cluster.

__TL;DR:__ Go to the [charts directory](charts/), and deploy it to your cluster with `helm install . --name build-monitor`. To set the configuration you need to modify the values.yaml file. See [Readme](charts/README.md) in chart folder for more informations.

### Theming support

Here you can check out the existing themes. Feel free to [add your own](#creating-a-new-theme) and make a pull request. It can be done very easy.

| Theme   | Description                                                                        | Preview
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| default | Works best on bigger screens with a high resolution                                | [Demo](http://builds.mspi.es)
| lowres  | Works best on screens with a lower resolution                                      | [Demo](http://builds.mspi.es?theme=lowres)
| list    | Displays the builds as a list, instead of tiles                                    | [Demo](http://builds.mspi.es?theme=list)
| lingo   | Describes the build status in form of a hand-written sentence                      | [Demo](http://builds.mspi.es?theme=lingo)

You can switch the themes by the url parameter `theme`.
e.g.: [http://localhost:3000?theme=list](http://localhost:3000?theme=list)

#### Creating a new theme

If you want to create a new theme, you simply have to create one template file and one stylesheet in the following paths.
- Stylesheet: `app/public/stylesheets/themes/[name of theme]/style.css` (you can place dependent css files in this folder)
- Template: `app/public/templates/themes/[name of theme]/.html`

Please use a unique class prefix like `[name of theme]-theme` for your css, so that we do not run into any conflicts with other themes.

A list with the name `builds` with Knockout.js ViewModels [BuildViewModel](app/public/scripts/BuildViewModel.js) will be bound to the template. [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) has a very low learning curve and provides a powerful data-binding mechanism.

Just check out the other themes to get sample code. It's quite easy to create new themes.

### Additional: Raspberry Pi Configuration

Here are some useful links, how to run the build monitor frontend on a Raspberry Pi.

- [Boot to browser](http://blog.niteoweb.com/raspberry-pi-boot-to-browser/)
- [Automatically turn the monitor off in the evening](http://glframebuffer.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/raspberrypi-how-to-turn-off-hdmi-from-raspberry-pi/)

This sample script can be used in a cronjob to automatically send your screen to sleep mode in the evening and wake it up in the morning.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $1 = 'on' ]; then
  tvservice -p;
  fbset -depth 8;
  fbset -depth 16;
  chvt 6;
  chvt 7;
  echo 'Switched Screen ON!'
fi

if [ $1 = 'off' ]; then
  tvservice -o
  echo 'Switched Screen OFF!'
fi
```
